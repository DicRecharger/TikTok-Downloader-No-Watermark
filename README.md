# TikTok-Downloader-No-Watermark
A simple Python script to use a website in order to download TikToks without a watermark.

This script is super simple and very basic, it does not do much and it is useless using it on its own. You can just go to the website itself and download the TikToks from there.

I made this as a base to anyone trying to make a bot or a GUI or something, so feel free to use this if you cannot find anything better. Of course there are ways you can download TikToks without using a specific website, but it is way more complicated than this.

This script can be easily editted and made so it downloads many TikTok videos instead of one at a time.

To use this just run it and input your TikTok URL, it should work with the larger ones as well.
